      hold on for nostalgia, but learn with our past. Sometimes, things
      can’t be avoided, but we can surely learn from them.`,

    everything is going to be okay. I like the fact that lyrics can be about

    though the song came out in 1980 it’s still popular nowadays, as
    many people say “Classic never dies”.`,
